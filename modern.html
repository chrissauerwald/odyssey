    <h3>The continued popularity of the Odyssey in the 20th Century</h3>

			<p class="main">The story of the <em>Odyssey</em> continued to be a mainstay of classical education through the 20th century and even into the 21st century. While the study of the classics at schools and universities has waned, the story of the <em>Odyssey</em> continues to fascinate modern readers and audiences. Modern scholars have taken a more inclusive and insightful approach to translation, attempting to preserve the original meaning of Homer's Greek without resorting to embellishment. Differences in translation still persist, but more care has been taken in explaining these differences. The version of the text reviewed here is a translation by S. H. (Samuel Henry) Butcher and Andrew Lang. Butcher was an Irish academic and politician who taught at Trinity College, Oxford, and the University of Edinburgh. He was a noted classicist of his era. Lang was a Scottish poet and author who contributed scholarship to history, anthropology, and folklore. The version of the <em>Odyssey</em> displayed above includes a poem written by Lang, inspired by the epic story.</p>

<p class="main">The <em>Odyssey</em> is an enduring story highlighting the trials and tribulations of one man's journey to get home. Its themes continue to be discussed by literature students the world over, and the story is rife with allegory. The <em>Odyssey</em> has served as the basis for numerous screen adaptations, as well as alternative retellings, transplanting Homer's ancient Greek characters to the modern day or even to the stars themselves. In many respects, the continued fascination with the <em>Odyssey</em> highlights the enduring impact of Homer's work and why this exhibit is so timely and pertinent to modern audiences.</p>
