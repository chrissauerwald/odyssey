    <h2>How have written versions of Homer's Odyssey changed over time?</h2>
    
    <h3>A brief explanation of Homer's Odyssey:</h3>
    
    <p class="main">The works of the Greek poet Homer have been a mainstay of Western literature since their creation in the eighth or mid-seventh century BCE (Before Common Era). Originally believed to have been oral performances, Homer's epic poems <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em> have survived through the centuries and have proven to be some of the most enduring stories of Western literature. While the <em>Iliad</em> chronicles the epic siege of Troy, the <em>Odyssey</em> focuses on the journey of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, on his 10-year quest to return home to his wife Penelope and son Telemachus. Confronted by myriad dangers—including the sorceress Circe, the Sirens, the Cyclops Polyphemus, and the wrath of Poseidon—Odysseus ultimately makes it home to his wife and son, nearly 20 years after his departure. It is a gripping adventure story that has been repeated and emulated by hundreds of writers and poets in the centuries since.</p>

    <h3>About this exhibit</h3>
    
    <p class="main">The following pages are an exhibit charting the printed record of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> from its earliest recording in the 3rd century BCE to the 20th century. The exhibit seeks to highlight the different versions of the <em>Odyssey</em> that have survived throughout the centuries. Each page examines a different historical period: <a href="ancient.html">Ancient</a>, <a href="medieval.html">Medieval</a>, <a href="early-modern.html">Early Modern</a>, and <a href="modern.html">Modern</a>. Alongside a discussion of the text, the exhibit seeks to place the <em>Odyssey</em> in its historical context, providing a glimpse into the world of the text's era and how a particular version was viewed.</p>
