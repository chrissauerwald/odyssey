    <h3>From the Byzantine Empire to the Renaissance</h3>

			<p class="main">Despite the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE (400s), the Empire survived in its eastern provinces, centered around modern-day Greece and Turkey. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">The Byzantine Empire</a> maintained and strengthened its connections to its ancient Greek roots during its existence. The story of the <em>Odyssey</em> was particularly interesting to Byzantine scribes, and numerous versions of the text have survived from the period. The version owned by Niccol√≤ Niccoli was originally copied in the 10th century in its original Greek and most likely came to Italy via the trade routes from the Byzantine Empire to the Italian city-states. During the medieval period, copies of texts had to be handwritten. Handwritten versions of the <em>Odyssey</em> from this time are known to contain transcription errors or edits made by scribes without regard for the original text. Scholars at <a href="https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/collex/exhibits/homer-print-transmission-and-reception-homers-works/">the University of Chicago's library</a> have indicated that these editorial choices and transcription errors make understanding the relationship between medieval manuscript versions of the <em>Odyssey</em> difficult to navigate. Compounding these issues is the fact that, until the mid-fifteenth century, many of the classical Greek scholars, poets, and writers were unknown in the West. Their primary source on Homer was the <em>Illias Latina</em>, an abridged version of the <em>Iliad</em> with dubious authorship.</p>

<p class="main"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">The fall of Constantinople</a> in 1453 changed the Western world forever. Fleeing the collapse of the Byzantine Empire and the advancing armies of the Ottoman Empire, scholars fled west, carrying a treasure trove of ancient and medieval manuscripts and texts. Many of these landed in northern Italy, helping to spark the birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">the Renaissance</a>, the rebirth of classical learning "lost" to Western Europe since the fall of Rome. The Renaissance saw a flourishing of interest in the classical works of poets such as Homer, as well as renewed interest in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. Thanks to manuscripts saved from the Byzantine Empire, Western scholars had newer, complete versions of the ancient texts. Coupled with the invention and subsequent proliferation of the printing press, Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> was ripe for its own rebirth among the educated of Western Europe.</p>

<p class="main">The printed version of the <em>Odyssey</em> above, attributed to Demetrius Cretensis, was believed to have been printed in Florence, Italy, in 1488. It is in the original Greek, which initially served as a barrier to access despite its printing. Greek was not a common language in Western Europe, and while the printed text eliminated some of the issues with transcription errors from earlier texts, the language remained a barrier. As interest in the <em>Odyssey</em> increased, printers and their wealthy patrons began to invest in translating the <em>Odyssey</em>, first into Latin and then into the vernacular of the individual printer. Like Odysseus, the <em>Odyssey</em> had to traverse several challenges and hurdles in order to be understood by a wider audience.</p>
